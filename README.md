# Ortaylo-Portfolio

This Project was to organize the code for the Horiseon website to meet accessibility standards as well as fix some Errors

The HTML and CSS were both changed to allow for better Search engine optimization
and makes updating the site in the future easier

The main changes made to the websites code were simple labeling semantic HTML elements properly and adding comments to the css selectors
This will both allow for an easier understanding of whats going on in the code to allow for easier changes it also improved search enginge optimization
